#Background Information:
According to CEO Michael Storan, this Dublin-based compliance start-up is on a mission to "transform the way corporations and individuals alike think about personal data." In order to automate data privacy compliance across jurisdictions, Dataships has created a SaaS application. It seeks to simplify compliance for SMEs by removing the complexity of privacy policies, cookie consent tools, GDPR, and CCPA.
A year after GDPR went into effect, Storan and Ryan McErlane formed the start-up in 2019. Dataships received $3 million in seed funding from US and Irish investors in September of last year while it was a participant in the NDRC accelerator at Dogpatch Labs
Platforms for computing and communication have seen considerable developments in the hi-tech industry in recent years. The transition to a cloud environment from an on-premises architecture is one such notable technological change. Cloud computing is now at the center of most organizations' technological strategies. Over the past ten years, disruptive technological advancements have affected the computing industry, with cloud taking the lead. The value that the cloud offers is multifaceted. Cloud computing has completely superseded traditional computer methods, both in terms of cost reductions compared to old on-premise models and flexibility in services
#ON CLOUD 
Hosting data, software platforms, applications, and even resources in the cloud as opposed to on-premises is referred to as "on cloud." This is referred to as "cloud computing," which is a combination of two technologies: computing refers to computer-related resources, applications, and services, while cloud refers to networks.
Like the services offered by a telecom provider, businesses only pay for the services they really utilize. The cloud is more often connected to a subscription-based business model where you only pay for the services you actually utilize. In this case, computing is a cloud service, and clients are billed each month for using it.
#NON-CLOUD:
The term "Non-cloud" describes a computing strategy where a business hosts everything internally in an on-premise setting. Servers and server rooms, as well as software, platforms hardware, and infrastructure (including communications, storage, backup, and much more), are situated inside the organization's physical boundaries.
The main areas where on-premise computing and cloud computing diverge are in resource control and infrastructure management. On-site local hosts like desktops, laptops, and workstations host conventional computer applications.
In the next 18 months, 59% of IT buyers (engaged in the cloud computing buying process) stated they intended to be "largely" (43%) or "all," according to IDG's 2020 Cloud Computing Survey of over 500 IT professionals.
These numbers are higher than the 38% who claimed to use the cloud exclusively or primarily in 2018. Approximately 92% of respondents claimed that their organization's IT environment is currently at least partially in the cloud, while 8% claimed that their whole IT environment is on-premise
#KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CLOUD AND NON-CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES :
Pricing is the primary distinction between on-premise and cloud computing models. Additionally, it explains why their various pricing strategies exist.
Non-cloud environments use internal dedicated servers. They demand a substantial upfront cost to acquire. This expense covers the purchase of servers, software licensing, and a maintenance crew. Companies must also pay continuing costs for maintaining server space, power consumption, and hardware. In addition, internal infrastructure is a pretty tight architecture when it comes to resource expansion.
Cloud:An environment on the cloud offers minimal to no upfront expenditures. The client just pays for the use of the devices on a monthly or yearly basis; the supplier owns the infrastructure. The pay-as-you-go finance model is one where you only pay for the units and time that you really utilize. Additionally, investing in a technical team is not necessary with cloud computing. In some instances, the service provider also handles maintenance
#Deployment of resources:
Non-Cloud: Resources are deployed internally on the company's own server in an on-premises environment, as the name would imply. The server's data must be updated, safeguarded, and integrated entirely by the business.

For deployment of other technical infrastructure, it is wise to use google cloud when compared to on-premise storage as it would be very handy to access and integrate with google cloud
#Justification :
I firmly believe google cloud is better for Dataships company for a myriad of reasons. I am elucidating
a few of them in the following paragraph. The primary distinction between on-premise and google cloud which is being already adopted by the Dataships approaches is price. Additionally, it's the reason behind their various pricing approaches. In an on-premise setting, dedicated internal servers are used. They require a significant initial investment to acquire. This price includes the cost of purchasing servers, licensing software, and employing a maintenance crew. Additionally, businesses must cover ongoing expenses like server hardware, energy use, and storage. Furthermore, internal infrastructure has a relatively constrained architecture when it comes to resource expansion. In a cloud setting, startup costs are little to nonexistent. The client just pays for the devices they use on a monthly or annual basis. In a pay-as-you-go contractual relationship, you only pay for the units and time you actually use. Cloud computing also negates the need to hire technical staff
